=======

DATA Folder:

    ALL.mat  -  151 snapshots of u and v velocity as well as vorticity (UALL, VALL, VORTALL).  Also includes an extra snapshot for testing.  (snapshot resolution 449 x 199)

    basis.mat  -  Contains mean vorticity field, unsteady fixed point (vorticity) and leading 41 POD modes (vortPHI).

    ibpmUNSTEADY.plt  -  Tecplot file containing unsteady equilibrium solution

=======

Data is generated using Immersed Boundary Projection Method (IBPM) Code: 
    https://github.com/cwrowley/ibpm

IBPM code is based on immersed boundary method of Taira and Colonius:
